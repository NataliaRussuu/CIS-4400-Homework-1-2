NYC DOB  Approved Permits 
The Department of Buildings (DOB) issues permits for construction and demolition activities in New York City. The construction company must submit an application to DOB with details of the construction job they would like to complete. The primary types of application, aka job type, are: New Building, Demolition, and Alterations Type 1, 2, and 3. Each job type can have multiple work types, such as general construction, boiler, elevator, and plumbing. Each work type will receive a separate permit. A record in this dataset represents the life cycle of one permit for one type of work. The dataset is updated daily with new records, and each existing record will be updated as the permit application moves through the approval process to reflect the latest status of the application. The data set was made public on 6/28/2016.
